Question: killer "scenarios" for home automation
Pro: Cool, get into home > lights open automatically. It's enabling new possibilities.


===============================2. Costs===============================
Con: If manually buy parts and diy = 2.3k, for companies more expensive 5-15k
     Saving costs unimportant, not much difference.
     Equipment about maintenance also expensive, lamp vs smart lamp
     Automation will never make up for the cost
Pro: Installation expensive but only once. 
     Installation is easy nowadays, casual people can do it with manuals.
     Automation will get even cheaper in near future.
Con: Initial costs high, but installation not the only cost. 
     Like PC/Smartphone, need upgrades often, much higher cost.
     Support costs also high.
Pro: Automation more like TV, you don't need to upgrade it often
Con: Dependent on vendor. Can hold you "hostage"
Pro: Can do it on your own with open source.
Con: If you do it on your own, no centralization/integration, just separate entities.
     Too hard for casual people to do it on their own.
Pro: If there was standard it would be really easy, e.g. wifi
Con: But there is no standard.

3. Software

Question: What if automation fails?
Pro: always have a backup, not trusting power supply, e.g. carrying key as fail safe.
Con: not trusting your own system, so you always carry key

===============================3. Software===============================
Con: One company: monopoly, too expensive
     Multiple companies: no communication between them, no standard 
Pro: Depends on the product.
     Monopoly not good, you can choose multiple companies or open source.
Con: If you get a company, means not tech savvy, so you will also need to pay for support/updates.
Pro: Monthly subscription instead of update costs. Save energy.
Con: Not much impact if you save some energy on minor devices
Pro: Automated heating saves a lot of money.
Con: Reheating the house is more expensive than average temperature.


Question: Where should the logic of automation be. house or cloud...
Pro: Probably in the home.
Con: Insecure if in home.

Question: Energy efficient also about environmental aspects?
Con: Impact is the same, you save from energy you spend

Question: Can't you save much more energy with good insulation instead of automation?
Pro: Both can be good.
Con: Also costs for insulation? Too expensive.

===============================4. Interfaces===============================
Pro: Standard protocols for wireless and low power.
     No need for cables, wireless.
     If standard exists, it would be really easy.

     if bug was taken advantage, hackers could disable alarm system and unlock doors when people out of home

Con: Agree. Hackers target widespread standard solutions. But maybe less secure if someone actually looks into the system.
Con: Takes a lot of work to diy.


===============================6. Being supervised/Privacy===============================

Pro: Automation needs to know about your behavious so it can adjust.
Con: Nobody would want someone/something being in their home. 
     If on automation on cloud, you don't know who violates your privacy
