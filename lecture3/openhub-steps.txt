LED example

https://mcuoneclipse.com/2015/12/24/blinky-led-with-openhab-on-raspberry-pi/

- I followed the example and the led was working
- PROBLEM: GUI was reverse of the LED state (when I was turning on the LED on the GUI it turned off, and vice versa)
  SOLUTION: Probably some kind of bug, switched to another GPIO and worked as expected

- Need to group leds so all of them turn on and off

- Added one other led, now I need to make the button work.

PROBLEM: doesn't change values with gpio command when pressing
SOLUTION: changed button gpio and now it randomly works
